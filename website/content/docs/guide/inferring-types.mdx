title: Inferring Types
description: Inferring typescript Types from Refs
---

In some cases you may want to use the types from your input of object refs to build helpers, or
provide accurate types for other functions.

To get types from any Pothos `ref` object, you can use the `$inferType` and `$inferInput` properties
on the ref. This pattern is inspired by [drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/).

```ts
const MyInput = builder.inputType('MyInput', {
  fields: (t) => ({
    id: t.id({ required: true }),
    name: t.string({ required: true }),
  }),
});

// { id: string; name: string; }
type MyInputShape = typeof MyInput.$inferInput; /

// infer the shape of the Prisma User model
const UserRef = builder.prismaObject('User', {});
type UserType = typeof UserRef.$inferType;
```
