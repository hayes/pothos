# Interactive Playground

Explore Pothos GraphQL schema building with interactive examples. Each example shows the TypeScript code, generated GraphQL schema, and lets you run queries.

## Usage Patterns

You can embed playground-enabled code blocks using different patterns:

### 1. Inline Code with Playground

Add the `playground` attribute to any code block to enable the "Open in Playground" button. The code from the block will be loaded when clicked:

```ts playground
import SchemaBuilder from '@pothos/core';

const builder = new SchemaBuilder({});

builder.queryType({
  fields: (t) => ({
    hello: t.string({
      args: {
        name: t.arg.string({ required: false }),
      },
      resolve: (_, args) => `Hello, ${args.name ?? 'World'}!`,
    }),
  }),
});

export const schema = builder.toSchema();
```

### 2. With Pre-Registered Examples

Reference a pre-registered example by ID. The example's full configuration (multiple files, default query) will be loaded:

```ts playground example="basic-types"
import SchemaBuilder from '@pothos/core';

const builder = new SchemaBuilder({});

// This code is shown in the docs, but when opened in playground
// it loads the full "basic-types" example with all its files
builder.queryType({
  fields: (t) => ({
    hello: t.string({
      resolve: () => 'Hello, World!',
    }),
  }),
});

export const schema = builder.toSchema();
```

### 3. With GraphQL Query

Provide a query to pre-populate the GraphiQL tab and automatically switch to it:

```ts playground query="{ hello }"
import SchemaBuilder from '@pothos/core';

const builder = new SchemaBuilder({});

builder.queryType({
  fields: (t) => ({
    hello: t.string({
      resolve: () => 'Hello, World!',
    }),
  }),
});

export const schema = builder.toSchema();
```

### 4. Example + Custom Query

Combine an example with a custom query to guide users to specific functionality:

```ts playground example="basic-types" query="{ user { id name email } }"
// Opens the basic-types example with a pre-populated query
```

## How It Works

Each playground has three tabs:

1. **Code** - The TypeScript source code using Pothos
2. **Schema** - The generated GraphQL SDL
3. **GraphiQL** - An interactive query editor

Try modifying the queries in the GraphiQL tab to explore the schema!
