# Interactive Playground

Explore Pothos GraphQL schema building with interactive examples. Each example shows the TypeScript code, generated GraphQL schema, and lets you run queries.

## Basic Types

Learn how to define object types and queries:

<PlaygroundEmbed example="basic-types" />

## Mutations

Define mutations with input types:

<PlaygroundEmbed example="mutations" />

## Interfaces & Unions

Using interfaces and union types for polymorphism:

<PlaygroundEmbed example="interfaces" />

## How It Works

Each playground has three tabs:

1. **Code** - The TypeScript source code using Pothos
2. **Schema** - The generated GraphQL SDL
3. **GraphiQL** - An interactive query editor

Try modifying the queries in the GraphiQL tab to explore the schema!
