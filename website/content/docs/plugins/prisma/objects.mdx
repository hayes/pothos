## Creating types with `builder.prismaObject`

`builder.prismaObject` takes 2 arguments:

1. `name`: The name of the prisma model this new type represents
2. `options`: options for the type being created, this is very similar to the options for any other
   object type

```typescript
builder.prismaObject('User', {
  // Optional name for the object, defaults to the name of the prisma model
  name: 'PostAuthor',
  fields: (t) => ({
    id: t.exposeID('id'),
    email: t.exposeString('email'),
  }),
});

builder.prismaObject('Post', {
  fields: (t) => ({
    id: t.exposeID('id'),
    title: t.exposeString('title'),
  }),
});
```

So far, this is just creating some simple object types. They work just like any other object type in
Pothos. The main advantage of this is that we get the type information without using object refs, or
needing imports from prisma client.

## Adding prisma fields to non-prisma objects (including Query and Mutation)

There is a new `t.prismaField` method which can be used to define fields that resolve to your prisma
types:

```typescript
builder.queryType({
  fields: (t) => ({
    me: t.prismaField({
      type: 'User',
      resolve: async (query, root, args, ctx, info) =>
        prisma.user.findUniqueOrThrow({
          ...query,
          where: { id: ctx.userId },
        }),
    }),
  }),
});
```

This method works just like the normal `t.field` method with a couple of differences:

1. The `type` option must contain the name of the prisma model (eg. `User` or `[User]` for a list
   field).
2. The `resolve` function has a new first argument `query` which should be spread into query prisma
   query. This will be used to load data for nested relationships.

You do not need to use this method, and the `builder.prismaObject` method returns an object ref than
can be used like any other object ref (with `t.field`), but using `t.prismaField` will allow you to
take advantage of more efficient queries.

The `query` object will contain an object with `include` or `select` options to pre-load data needed
to resolve nested parts of the current query. The included/selected fields are based on which fields
are being queried, and the options provided when defining those fields and types.
