description: how to use custom includes and selections to optimize your prisma queries

## Includes on types

In some cases, you may want to always pre-load certain relations. This can be helpful for defining
fields directly on type where the underlying data may come from a related table.

```typescript
builder.prismaObject('User', {
  // This will always include the profile when a user object is loaded.  Deeply nested relations can
  // also be included this way.
  include: {
    profile: true,
  },
  fields: (t) => ({
    id: t.exposeID('id'),
    email: t.exposeString('email'),
    bio: t.string({
      // The profile relation will always be loaded, and user will now be typed to include the
      // profile field so you can return the bio from the nested profile relation.
      resolve: (user) => user.profile.bio,
    }),
  }),
});
```

## Select mode for types

By default, the prisma plugin will use `include` when including relations, or generating fallback
queries. This means we are always loading all columns of a table when loading it in a
`t.prismaField` or a `t.relation`. This is usually what we want, but in some cases, you may want to
select specific columns instead. This can be useful if you have tables with either a very large
number of columns, or specific columns with large payloads you want to avoid loading.

To do this, you can add a `select` instead of an include to your `prismaObject`:

```typescript
builder.prismaObject('User', {
  select: {
    id: true,
  },
  fields: (t) => ({
    id: t.exposeID('id'),
    email: t.exposeString('email'),
  }),
});
```

The `t.expose*` and `t.relation` methods will all automatically add selections for the exposed
fields _WHEN THEY ARE QUERIED_, ensuring that only the requested columns will be loaded from the
database.

In addition to the `t.expose` and `t.relation`, you can also add custom selections to other fields:

```typescript
builder.prismaObject('User', {
  select: {
    id: true,
  },
  fields: (t) => ({
    id: t.exposeID('id'),
    email: t.exposeString('email'),
    bio: t.string({
      // This will select user.profile.bio when the `bio` field is queried
      select: {
        profile: {
          select: {
            bio: true,
          },
        },
      },
      resolve: (user) => user.profile.bio,
    }),
  }),
});
```

## Using arguments or context in your selections

The following is a slightly contrived example, but shows how arguments can be used when creating a
selection for a field:

```typescript
const PostDraft = builder.prismaObject('Post', {
  fields: (t) => ({
    title: t.exposeString('title'),
    commentFromDate: t.string({
      args: {
        date: t.arg({ type: 'Date', required: true }),
      },
      select: (args) => ({
        comments: {
          take: 1,
          where: {
            createdAt: {
              gt: args.date,
            },
          },
        },
      }),
      resolve: (post) => post.comments[0]?.content,
    }),
  }),
});
```

## Optimized queries without `t.prismaField`

In some cases, it may be useful to get an optimized query for fields where you can't use
`t.prismaField`.

This may be required for combining with other plugins, or because your query does not directly
return a `PrismaObject`. In these cases, you can use the `queryFromInfo` helper. An example of this
might be a mutation that wraps the prisma object in a result type.

```typescript
const Post = builder.prismaObject('Post', {...});

builder.objectRef<{
  success: boolean;
  post?: Post
  }>('CreatePostResult').implement({
  fields: (t) => ({
    success: t.boolean(),
    post: t.field({
      type: Post,
      nullable:
      resolve: (result) => result.post,
    }),
  }),
});

builder.mutationField(
  'createPost',
  {
    args: (t) => ({
      title: t.string({ required: true }),
      ...
    }),
  },
  {
    resolve: async (parent, args, context, info) => {
      if (!validateCreatePostArgs(args)) {
        return {
          success: false,
        }
      }

      const post = prisma.city.create({
        ...queryFromInfo({
          context,
          info,
          // nested path where the selections for this type can be found
          path: ['post']
          // optionally you can pass a custom initial selection, generally you wouldn't need this
          // but if the field at `path` is not selected, the initial selection set may be empty
          select: {
            comments: true,
          },
        }),
        data: {
          title: args.input.title,
          ...
        },
      });

      return {
        success: true,
        post,
      }
    },
  },
);
```
