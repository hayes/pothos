This plugin provides tighter integration with prisma, making it easier to define prisma based object
types, and helps solve n+1 queries for relations. It also has integrations for the relay plugin to
make defining nodes and connections easy and efficient.

This plugin is NOT required to use prisma with Pothos, but does make things a lot easier and more
efficient. See the [Using Prisma without a plugin](#using-prisma-without-a-plugin) section below for
more details.

## Features

- 🎨 Quickly define GraphQL types based on your Prisma models
- 🦺 Strong type-safety throughout the entire API
- 🤝 Automatically resolve relationships defined in your database
- 🎣 Automatic Query optimization to efficiently load the specific data needed to resolve a query
  (solves common N+1 issues)
- 💅 Types and fields in GraphQL schema are not implicitly tied to the column names or types in your
  database.
- 🔀 Relay integration for defining nodes and connections that can be efficiently loaded.
- 📚 Supports multiple GraphQL models based on the same Database model
- 🧮 Count fields can easily be added to objects and connections

## Example

Here is a quick example of what an API using this plugin might look like. There is a more thorough
breakdown of what the methods and options used in the example below.

```typescript
// Create an object type based on a prisma model
// without providing any custom type information
builder.prismaObject('User', {
  fields: (t) => ({
    // expose fields from the database
    id: t.exposeID('id'),
    email: t.exposeString('email'),
    bio: t.string({
      // automatically load the bio from the profile
      // when this field is queried
      select: {
        profile: {
          select: {
            bio: true,
          },
        },
      },
      // user will be typed correctly to include the
      // selected fields from above
      resolve: (user) => user.profile.bio,
    }),
    // Load posts as list field.
    posts: t.relation('posts', {
      args: {
        oldestFirst: t.arg.boolean(),
      },
      // Define custom query options that are applied when
      // loading the post relation
      query: (args, context) => ({
        orderBy: {
          createdAt: args.oldestFirst ? 'asc' : 'desc',
        },
      }),
    }),
    // creates relay connection that handles pagination
    // using prisma's built in cursor based pagination
    postsConnection: t.relatedConnection('posts', {
      cursor: 'id',
    }),
  }),
});

// Create a relay node based a prisma model
builder.prismaNode('Post', {
  id: { field: 'id' },
  fields: (t) => ({
    title: t.exposeString('title'),
    author: t.relation('author'),
  }),
});

builder.queryType({
  fields: (t) => ({
    // Define a field that issues an optimized prisma query
    me: t.prismaField({
      type: 'User',
      resolve: async (query, root, args, ctx, info) =>
        prisma.user.findUniqueOrThrow({
          // the `query` argument will add in `include`s or `select`s to
          // resolve as much of the request in a single query as possible
          ...query,
          where: { id: ctx.userId },
        }),
    }),
  }),
});
```

Given this schema, you would be able to resolve a query like the following with a single prisma
query (which will still result in a few optimized SQL queries).

```graphql
query {
  me {
    email
    posts {
      title
      author {
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

A query like

```graphql
query {
  me {
    email
    posts {
      title
      author {
        id
      }
    }
    oldPosts: posts(oldestFirst: true) {
      title
      author {
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Will result in 2 calls to prisma, one to resolve everything except `oldPosts`, and a second to
resolve everything inside `oldPosts`. Prisma can only resolve each relation once in a single query,
so we need a separate query to handle the second `posts` relation.
