description: Using the Prisma and Relay plugins together
---

This plugin has extensive integration with the
[relay plugin](https://pothos-graphql.dev/docs/plugins/relay), which makes creating nodes and
connections very easy.

### `prismaNode`

The `prismaNode` method works just like the `prismaObject` method with a couple of small
differences:

- there is a new `id` option that mirrors the `id` option from `node` method of the relay plugin,
  and must contain a resolve function that returns the id from an instance of the node. Rather than
  defining a resolver for the id field, you can set the `field` option to the name of a unique
  column or index.

```typescript
builder.prismaNode('Post', {
  // This sets what database field to use for the nodes id field
  id: { field: 'id' },
  // fields work just like they do for builder.prismaObject
  fields: (t) => ({
    title: t.exposeString('title'),
    author: t.relation('author'),
  }),
});
```

If you need to customize how ids are formatted, you can add a resolver for the `id`, and provide a
`findUnique` option that can be used to load the node by its id. This is generally not necessary.

```typescript
builder.prismaNode('Post', {
  id: { resolve: (post) => String(post.id) },
  // The return value will be passed as the `where` of a `prisma.post.findUnique`
  findUnique: (id) => ({ id: Number.parseInt(id, 10) }),
  fields: (t) => ({
    title: t.exposeString('title'),
    author: t.relation('author'),
  }),
});
```

When executing the `node(id: ID!)` query with a global ID for which prisma cannot find a record in
the database, the default behavior is to throw an error. There are some scenarios where it is
preferable to return `null` instead of throwing an error. For this you can add the `nullable: true`
option:

```typescript
builder.prismaNode('Post', {
  id: { resolve: (post) => String(post.id) },
  nullable: true,
  fields: (t) => ({
    title: t.exposeString('title'),
    author: t.relation('author'),
  }),
});
```
