description: Migration guide for upgrading from Pothos 3.x to Pothos 4.0
---

## Overview

Migrating from Pothos 3.x to 4.0

The `4.0` release of Pothos is largely focused on updating 4 things:

1. Improving outdated defaults to be more consistent and aligned with best practices
2. Updating naming of some config options to be more consistent
3. Updating minimum versions of peer dependencies
4. Updating internal types to support some previously challenging plugin patterns

While the internals of Pothos have almost entirely been re-written, the public API surface should
have a minimal changes for most users. The first 2 sets of changes will cover the majority of
changes relevant to the majority of applications. To make the make the upgrade as simple as
possible, some options were added to maintain the defaults and option names from `3.x` which are
described in the simple upgrade section below.

## New minimum versions

- `typescript`: `4.7.0`
- `graphql`: `16.6.0`
- `node`: `18.0`

## Simple Upgrade (restore 3.0 options and defaults)

You can restore the 3.x defaults by adding the Defaults versions to both the SchemaTypes and the
builder options:

```ts
const builder = new SchemaBuilder<{
  Defaults: 'v3';
}>({
  defaults: 'v3',
});
```

This will restore all the defaults and config options from previous Pothos versions for both core
and plugins.

If you are using `@pothos/plugin-validation`, it has been renamed to `@pothos/plugin-zod`, and a new
validation plugin will be released in the future.

```diff
- import ValidationPlugin from '@pothos/plugin-validation';
+ import ZodPlugin from '@pothos/plugin-zod';

const builder = new SchemaBuilder({
-  plugins: [ValidationPlugin],
+  plugins: [ZodPlugin],
});
```

## Manual update

There are a number of new defaults and changes to options for various plugins. To fully upgrade to
4.0 see the full list of breaking changes below:

# Breaking API Changes:

This section covers breaking API changes that can be automatically reverted by using the Simple
Upgrade process described above.

Changes to types and classes outside the main Pothos API are described in the next section. Those
changes will primarily affect other plugins and tools written for pothos, but may be relevant to
some type helpers you have created.

## `@pothos/core`

### Default field nullability

In previous versions of Pothos, fields were non-nullable by default. This is inconsistent with the
rest of the GraphQL ecosystem, so the default is being changed to make fields nullable by default.

To restore the previous behavior you can set the `defaultFieldNullability` option when creating your
builder:

```ts
export const builder = new SchemaBuilder<{
  DefaultFieldNullability: false;
}>({
  defaultFieldNullability: false,
});
```

Alternatively, fields can be updated to add `nullable: false` to the fields options.

### Default ID Scalar types

The default types for the built in `ID` Scalar has been changed to more closely match the behavior
of Javascript GraphQL server implementations:

```ts
interface IDType {
  Input: string;
  Output: number | string | bigint;
}
```

This will make working with IDs in arguments and input types easier by avoiding unnecessary type
checks to see if an `ID` is a `number` or `string`.

When returning an `ID` from a scalar you will be able to return a `string`, `number`, or `bigint`.

To restore the previous defaults you can customize the `ID` scalar types when creating your builder:

```ts
const builder = new SchemaBuilder<{
  Scalars: {
    ID: {
      Input: number | string;
      Output: number | string;
    };
  };
}>({});
```

## `@pothos/plugin-relay`

### Renamed options

The base relay plugin options have moved from `relayOptions` to `relay` to be more consistent with
options for other plugins.

```diff
 const builder = new SchemaBuilder<{}>({
-  relayOptions: {...}
+  relay: {...}
 })
```

### New defaults

A number of the default values for relay options have changed:

- `clientMutationId`: Now defaults to `"omit"` and was previously `"required"`
  - `clientMutationId` was only required in early versions of the relay client, and is no-longer
    recommended.
- `cursorType`: Now defaults to `"String"` and was previously `"ID"`
  - The previous defaults were inconsistent about the type of a cursor. Cursors generally should not
    be treated as IDs as they are meant to indicate a position in a list, and may contain
    information specific to other filters or arguments applied to the connection.
- `brandLoadedObjects`: Now defaults to `true` and was previously `false`
  - This change will improve developer experience for most node implementations, as it removes the
    need for `isTypeOf` to be defined for most nodes.
- `edgesFieldOptions.nullable`: Now defaults to
  `{ list: options.defaultFieldNullability, items: true }` and was previously
  `{ list: false, items: true }`
- `nodeFieldOptions.nullable`: Now defaults to `options.defaultFieldNullability` and was previously
  `false`
  - This new default is intended to align with the relay connection spec, which does not expect
    connections to be NonNullable by default

To restore the previous defaults you can pass the old values when setting up the builder:

```ts
const builder = new SchemaBuilder<{
  // To change edgesFieldOptions.nullable you must also update the type here
  DefaultEdgesNullability: { list: false; items: true };
}>({
  relay: {
    clientMutationId: 'required',
    brandLoadedObjects: false,
    edgesFieldOptions: {
      nullable: { list: false, items: true },
    },
    nodeFieldOptions: {
      nullable: false,
    },
    cursorType: 'ID',
    // the cursor fields on edges and pageInfo previously defaulted to `String`
    // but will be overwritten by `cursorType` so you also need to explicity set them
    edgeCursorType: 'String',
    pageInfoCursorType: 'String',
  },
});
```

## `@pothos/plugin-prisma`

### Nullable relations

Previously the prisma would allow t.relation to define non-nullable fields using nullable relations.
The plugin option now requires an `onNull` option to handle null relations on NonNullable fields

To restore the previous behavior you can set the `onNull` option to `'error'`, which will result in
a runtime error when the field returns null

```diff
 t.relation('nullableRelation', {
+  onNull: 'error',
 })
```

Alternatively you can mark the field as nullable:

```diff
 t.relation('nullableRelation', {
+  nullable: true,
 })
```

`onNull` can also be set to a function that returns either a record matching the type of the
relation, or a custom Error to throw when the relation is null.

```ts
t.relation('nullableRelation', {
  onNull: () => loadPlaceholder(),
});
```

## `@pothos/plugin-directives`

`useGraphQLToolsUnorderedDirectives` has been nested inside a `directives` options object:

```diff
 const builder = new SchemaBuilder<{}>({
-  useGraphQLToolsUnorderedDirectives: true
+  directives: {
+    useGraphQLToolsUnorderedDirectives: true
+  }
 })
```

## `@pothos/plugin-errors`

### Renamed options

The base error plugin options have moved from `errorOptions` to `errors` to be more consistent with
options for other plugins.

```diff
 const builder = new SchemaBuilder<{}>({
-  errorOptions: {...}
+  errors: {...}
 })
```

## `@pothos/plugin-scope-auth`

### Renamed options

The base scope-auth plugin options have moved from `scopeAuthOptions` to `scopeAuth` to be more
consistent with options for other plugins. The `authScopes` option has been moved to
`scopeAuth.authScopes` to keep all options for the plugin in one options object.

```diff
 const builder = new SchemaBuilder<{}>({
-  scopeAuthOptions: {...}
-  authScopes: (ctx) => ({...})
+  scopeAuth: {
+    ...otherOptions,
+    authScopes: (ctx) => ({...})
+  }
 })
```

## `@pothos/plugin-zod` (previously `@pothos/plugin-validation`)

### Renamed options

The base validation plugin options have moved from `validationOptions` to `validation` to be more
consistent with options for other plugins.

```diff
 const builder = new SchemaBuilder<{}>({
-  validationOptions: {...}
+  zod: {...}
 })
```

## `@pothos/plugin-authz` has been removed

The `@pothos/plugin-authz` plugin has been removed, because the underlying `@graphql-authz/core` is
not actively maintained, and has left critical security vulnerabilities unaddressed.

# Plugin API and Type changes

Unlike the defaults and config changes, the changes to the types and classes used throughout Pothos
can't be easily made backwards compatibility with the 3.x releases. Below is a summary of the main
changes made to the types and classes that may be used by plugins, helpers, or other libraries. Many
of these types and classes are primarily intended for internal use, and should not affect most
applications using pothos, but the changes are documented here to help upgrades for those of you
building your own plugins, or using these types in your applications.

The 4.0 release is intended to allow pothos to become more modular and extensible. This requires
Refs and many associated type helpers to propagate the SchemaTypes from the builder that originated
them, meaning most of the changes listed below are adding `Types extends SchemaTypes` as the first
generic argument to the type.

## Classes

  - Removed the `typename` argument from the constructor
  - Updated field methods to return a new `GenericInputRef`

  - split argument refs into a new `ArgumentRef` class

## Exported types

- `*FieldThunk`
  - Updated to return a `GenericFieldRef<unknown>`
- `FieldMap`
  - Updated to `Record<string, GenericFieldRef<unknown>>;`
- `InputFieldMap`
  - Updated to `Record<string, GenericInputFieldRef<unknown>>;`
- `InputFieldsFromShape`
  - Added `SchemaTypes` as a new Generic parameter
- `InputShapeFromField`
  - Updated to accept a `GenericFieldRef`

## Field options

The global interfaces for FieldOptions no-longer include the `resolve` option, which has moved to
the `InferredFieldOptions` interface to allow plugins to replace or change the resolve functions
types globally.

This means that when extending the `FieldOptionsByKind` interface, if you previously extended one of
the built in Field option interfaces, you will need to update your types to include the `resolve`
function types as well:

```diff
export interface FieldOptionsByKind<
  Types extends SchemaTypes,
  ParentShape,
  Type extends TypeParam<Types>,
  Nullable extends FieldNullability<Type>,
  Args extends InputFieldMap,
  ResolveShape,
  ResolveReturnShape,
> {
- CustomObjectObject: CustomOptions<Types> &
-   PothosSchemaTypes.ObjectFieldOptions<
-     Types,
-     ParentShape,
-     Type,
-     Nullable,
-     Args,
-     ResolveReturnShape
-   >;
+ CustomObjectObject: CustomOptions<Types> &
+   PothosSchemaTypes.ObjectFieldOptions<
+     Types,
+     ParentShape,
+     Type,
+     Nullable,
+     Args,
+     ResolveReturnShape
+   > &
+   InferredFieldOptionsByKind<
+     Types,
+     Types['InferredFieldOptionsKind'],
+     ParentShape,
+     Type,
+     Nullable,
+     Args,
+     ResolveReturnShape
+   >;
}
```

The `InferredFieldOptionsByKind` interface can be used to get the `resolve` option by default, but
will also work for plugins that replace the `resolve` function with a different options for
configuring how a field is resolved. Some custom object types may want to explicitly define a
`resolve` option type, or omit it entirely (eg, the SimpleObject plugin does not use resolvers).
